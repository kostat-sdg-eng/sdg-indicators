# Progress on sustainable development goals by ethnicity

Most of the data used to report on the UK's progress towards the sustainable development goals (SDGs) can be broken down by sex or age but rarely by ethnicity.

To help close this gap, we have worked with the Race Disparity Unit who own the Ethnicity facts and figures website, to see where their data can support the SDGs.
